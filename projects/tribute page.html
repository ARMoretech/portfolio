<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Mirzā Ghulām Aḥmad (13 February 1835 – 26 May 1908) was an Indian
     religious leader and the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement in 
     Islam. He claimed to have been divinely appointed as the promised
      Messiah and Mahdī—which is the metaphorical second-coming of 
      Jesus (mathīl-iʿIsā), in fulfillment of the Islamic prophecies 
      regarding the end times, as well as the Mujaddid (centennial 
      reviver) of the 14th Islamic century.</p>
<h2>Post Claim</h2>
<p>In time, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad's claim of being the Mujaddid 
    (reformer) of his era became more explicit. In one of his 
    most well-known and praisedworks, Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya,
   a voluminous work, he claimed to be the Messiah of Islam.
   Muslims have maintained that Jesus will return in the flesh 
   during the last age. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, by contrast, asserted
    that Jesus had in fact survived crucifixion and died of old
     age much later in Kashmir, where he had migrated. 
     According to Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the promised Mahdi was a
      symbolic reference to a spiritual leader and not a
       military leader in the person of Jesus Christ as is 
       believed by many Muslims. With this proclamation, he 
       also rejected the idea of armed Jihad and argued that 
       the conditions for such Jihad are not present in this 
       age, which requires defending Islam by the pen and 
       tongue but not with the sword.
       Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote two books named Tuhfa-e-Qaiseriya
        and Sitara-e-Qaiseriya in which he invited Queen Victoria 
        to embrace Islam and forsake Christianity.</p>
